    <h1> <strong>The Story behind the Brand </strong></h1><br>
    <p>The Truth is within a heap of rubble lies a gem. The question is, who has the time to look and find it? Well  when it comes to this gem it was within the creators of the brand. Mo always had a affinity to T-shirts. As a kid he would go to the west village to shop for graphic t's that depicted what he was feeling at the time. He would later go on to team up with his older brother Diangelo and create a clothing company that would not only become an over night success but a true test to their brotherhood. Selling out of retail stores and thrusting them into the thrawls of success the two would learn that running a business is not only hard work but is also built on great partnerships. The compaany would flourish but be plagued by bad  business agreements. By the third year the duos million dollar baby would be stolen from them and the two would part ways as partners but continue to have a great personal relationship. Many opportunities have come and gone for them to create a new company but life never allowed any of those opportunities to be entertained. Now older and wiser they are teaming up to create a new brand. the brand will be an organic creation by the duo with riveting images that awakens those who want to say something about the issues of today but dont have the time. they can now wear their position on social topics and let those know what their position is without saying a word.</p>
